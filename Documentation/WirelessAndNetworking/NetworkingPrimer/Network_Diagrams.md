# Network Diagrams

Here are two diagrams to illustrate the *idea* of what we wanted our network to operate as. However, there is a debate on whether or not it is better to statically assign all device IP addresses instead of having the routers assign IP addresses to all devices in their respective networks. The reason behind this is in the event that the router malfunctions, devices may not be able to communicate on the network (as RobotX Network Operator Bill Porter mentioned).
