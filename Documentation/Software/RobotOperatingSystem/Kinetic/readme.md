# Installing ROS Kinetic
This tutorial assumes that you already have Ubuntu 16.04 installed on your machine.

## Prerequisites
   1. Ubuntu 16.04 ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/Ubuntu)).
   2. Standard .bashrc inclusions ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/.bashrc_inclusions)).

## Installation instructions
Detailed instructions are available at the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).  Our instrctions are a more concise version of these.  

First, if you're not sure if you already have an existing version of ros, uninstall with:

```
sudo apt-get purge ros-*
```

Setup your Apt sources list and keys:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
```

Ensure Apt debian package index is up-to-date:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Install using Apt

```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```
Type `y`, then hit `enter` to confirm the install.

Next, find available ROS packages in Apt.

```
apt-cache search ros-kinetic
```

Initialize rosdep

```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Setup your ROS environment Environment setup

```
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install Python for ROS

```
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
sudo apt-get install python-rospkg
```

Type `y`, then hit `enter` to confirm the install.

Next, ensure that you've add our standard .bashrc inclusions (this was a prerequisite, but make sure you've done this if you haven't already).  Detailed instrcuctions can be found in [this directory](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/.bashrc_inclusions).

Create ROS workspace

```
cd
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```

## Install ROS Packages
Lists with installation instructions for groupings of ROS packages for various functionalities can be found in their respective project folders.  You should install all of the packages associated with each project you want to reproduce.
