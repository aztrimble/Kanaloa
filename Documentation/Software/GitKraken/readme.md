# GitKraken

GitKraken is a third-party cross-platform GUI for Git.  Github offers a first-party desktop client called [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/); however, as of writing, this software is not available for Linux.

## Prerequisites
   1. Ubuntu 16.04 ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/Ubuntu)).
   
## Installation instructions
Official installation instructions can be found [at this link](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install).  Our instructions are a more concise version of the official ones.  

First, open a new terminal window, and download and install GitKraken using:

```
wget https://release.gitkraken.com/linux/gitkraken-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i gitkraken-amd64.deb
```

That's it, you're done!  You can test your installation by launching GitKraken.  Open a new terminal window and type:
  
```
gitkraken
```

The software should launch without issue.
