# MOSFETs

A MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) is a type of field effect transistor (FET) that is used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. 

A MOSFET has three leads, the gate, drain, and source.  By applying voltage at the gate, the MOSFET generates an electrical field to control the current flow through the channgel between the drain and the source.  There is no current flow from the gate into the MOSFET.  There are two types of MOSFETs: N-channel and, P-channel, as shown in the figure:
