# Battery Comparison

The purpose of this document is to analyze, at a very high level, the price-to-performance characteristics of nickel metal hydride, and lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

There are generally four different classes of rechargeable battery:

 1. Lead Acid
 2. Lithium Ion Li-Ion
 3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)
 4. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh)

It is generally well understood that NiMh and Li-Ion batteries provide the best performance in energy density, this document will explort the difference between these two technologies.
