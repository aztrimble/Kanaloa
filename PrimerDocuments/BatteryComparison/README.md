# Battery Comparison

The purpose of this document is to analyze, at a very high level, the price-to-performance characteristics of nickel metal hydride, and lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

There are generally four different classes of rechargeable battery:

 1. Lead Acid
 2. Lithium Ion Li-Ion
 3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)
 4. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh)

It is generally well understood that NiMh and Li-Ion batteries provide the best performance in energy density, this document will explore the difference between these two technologies.

  - Battery Specifications
    - price: $339.99
    - capacity: 105 Ah or 1260 Wh per battery
    - max discharge: 800 A (cold), 1000 A ("marine")
    - mass: 31.3 kg per battery
    - volume: (0.32861m)(0.17145m)(0.23813m) = 0.013416 m^3 ≈ 13416 mL
  - Calculations:
    - $/Wh = (339.99$)/(1260Wh) = $0.26983 per Wh ≈ __$0.27 per Wh__ (lower is better)
    - mass energy density = (1260Wh)/(31.3kg) = 40.256 Wh per kg ≈ __40 Wh per kg__ (higher is better)
    - volumetric energy density = (1260Wh)/(0.013416m^3) = 93918 Wh per m^3 ≈ __93 kWh per m^3__ (higher is better)
