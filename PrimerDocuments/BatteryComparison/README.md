# Battery Comparison

The purpose of this document is to analyze, at a very high level, the price-to-performance characteristics of nickel metal hydride, and lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

There are generally four different classes of rechargeable battery:

 1. Lead Acid
 2. Lithium Ion Li-Ion
 3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)
 4. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh)

It is generally well understood that NiMh and Li-Ion batteries provide the best performance in energy density, this document will explore the difference between these two technologies.

 - Battery Specifications:
   - price: $18.99 ($2.37 per battery)
   - capacity: 2.4 Ah or 2.88 Wh per battery
   - max discharge: 6 A per battery
   - mass: 31 g per battery
   - volume: (0.05m)*2*pi*(0.007m)^2 = 15.393E-6 m^3 ≈ 15.4 mL
 - Calculations:
   - $/Wh = (2.37$)/(2.88Wh) = $0.82291 per Wh ≈ __$0.82 per Wh__
   - mass energy density = (0.031kg)/(2.88Wh) = 0.010764 kg per Wh ≈ __0.011 kg per Wh__
   - volumetric energy density = (15.393E-6m^3)/(2.88Wh) = 5.3448 m^3 per Wh ≈ __5.3 mL per Wh__

  - Battery Specifications
    - price: $142.74 (on sale for $74.94 on 2018.11.11)
    - capacity: 16 Ah or 236.8 Wh
    - max discharge: 12C or 192 A
    - mass: 1290 g
    - volume: (0.173m)(0.074m)(0.045m) = 5.7609E-4 m^3 ≈ 576 mL
  - Calculations:
    - $/Wh = (142.74$)/(236.8Wh) = $0.60279 per Wh ≈ __$0.60 per Wh__
    - mass energy density = (1.290kg)/(236.8Wh) = 0.0054476 kg per Wh ≈ __0.0054476 kg per Wh__
