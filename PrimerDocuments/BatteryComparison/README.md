# Battery Comparison

The purpose of this document is to analyze, at a very high level, the price-to-performance characteristics of nickel metal hydride, and lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

There are generally four different classes of rechargeable battery:

 1. Lead Acid
 2. Lithium Ion Li-Ion
 3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)
 4. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh)

It is generally well understood that NiMh and Li-Ion batteries provide the best performance in energy density, this document will explore the difference between these two technologies.

 - Battery Specifications:
   - Price: $18.99 ($2.37 per battery)
   - Capacity: 2.4 Ah or 2.88 Wh per battery
   - Max discharge: 6A per battery
   - Mass: 31 g per battery
   - Volume: (0.05 m)*2*pi*(0.007m)^2 = 15.393E-6 m^3 ≈ 15.4 mL
 - Calculations:
   - $/Wh = (2.37 $)/(2.88 Wh) = $0.82291 per Wh ≈ __$0.82 per Wh__
   - mass energy density = (0.031 kg)/(2.88 Wh) = 0.010764 kg per Wh ≈ __0.011 kg per Wh__
   - volumetric energy density = (15.393E-6 m^3)/(2.88 Wh) = 5.3448 m^3 per Wh ≈ __5.3 mL per Wh__
