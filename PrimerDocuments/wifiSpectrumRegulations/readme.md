# Wi-Fi Spectrum Regulations
When operating a RF system, there are requirements put in place by the FCC (in the US) that effectively limit how much output power you can transmit.  A Wi-Fi network falls under this umbrella.  This document briefly discusses the regulations in place for operating a Wi-Fi network on an open frequency.

## Frequency use
Wi-Fi is a type of radio frequency (RF) communication, which fundamentally described by electromagnetic radiation with frequency in the range from 3 Hz to 3 GHz.  In practice, RF also overlaps slightly into the Super High Frequency (SHF) range from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, which technically falls under the microwave spectrum from electromagnetic radiation.  

Because RF is very useful for wireless communication, in all countries around the world, the RF spectrum is controlled by the government.  Here in the US, it is controlled by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), therefore, we should be following the laws they outline.  [A graphical depection of the RF frequency allocation in the US can be found here](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/2003-allochrt.pdf).
