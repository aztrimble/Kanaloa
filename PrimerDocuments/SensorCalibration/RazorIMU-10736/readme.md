# Razor 10736 IMU

As of 2019.03.23, the RIP Lab has three Razor 10736 IMU units.  Note that the hardware version (10736) is important, as there are multiple versions of this IMU.  It was purchased from this [Sparkfun listing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10736).  Sparkfun keeps their legcy hardware archived on their website, but in case it is taken down for any reason, the documents are archived in this Git.  Other important links are:

 - https://github.com/sparkfun/9DOF_Razor_IMU
 
 Note that the Github link is relevant for all versions of the Razor IMU.  When utilizing code from that Git, you must comment in which hardware revision you are using.
