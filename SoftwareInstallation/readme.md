# Software Installation
This directory contains instructions on the various software installations for our robot machines.  A brief summary of these are:

   1. `.bashrc_inclusions`: This directory contains instructions on how to add custom code to your Linux `bash` for our software to work properly.  The Linux `.bashrc` file is located in the `home` directory of a Linux machine, and allows the user to initialize various lines of code each time a new terminal window is open.  *Priority: mandatory*.
   2. `AnacondaPython`: This directory contains information on installing the Anaconda package installer + Python 3.  The Anaconda package installer is both a Python distribution containing various Python libraries targeted at scientific data computation, as well as a powerful package installer.  *Priority: only if you're coding in Python 3* (ROS has a Python 2.7 interpreter built in).
   3. `Matlab`: This directory contains information on installing Matlab.  *Priority: only if you need to run, or code in Matlab, which is likely*.
   4. `OpenCV-Python`: This directory contains information on installing OpenCV-Python.  This is used for various computer vision applications.  *Priority: only if you're coding computer vision applications*.
   5. `ROS`: This directory contains information on installing ROS (Robot Operating System).  *Priority: if you're doing any work in ROS, which is likely*.
   7. `Ubuntu`: This directory contains information on installing Ubnutu (a Linux distribution for x86 systems).  *Priority: mandatory`*.
