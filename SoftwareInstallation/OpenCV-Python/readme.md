# OpenCV-Python
OpenCV stands for "Open Computer Vision", and is a collection of C/C++ libraries specific for computer vison.  It has interfaces/APIs in C++, Python, and Java. 

## Prerequisites
1. Ubuntu 16.04 ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/Ubuntu)).
2. Standard .bashrc inclusions ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/.bashrc_inclusions)).
3. ROS Kinetic ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/ROS/Kinetic/InstallatonInstructions)).  Note that ROS is not actually required for this installation, rather ROS causes some issues with the OpenCV Python installation, and therefore some workaround instructions are provided in this guide.
4. Anaconda Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 install ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/AnacondaPython2.7-3.6)).

## Alternative Installation Options
OpenCV-Python can be installed using apt repositories (e.g. `sudo apt-get install python-opencv`); however, these repositories are generally out of date for OpenCV, and therefore are not ideal.  Aternatively, one can build from source; however, the official installation instructions found [at this link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html) are fairly poor.  There are third party instrcutions for installing from source like those from [Manuel Ignacio LÃ³pez Quintero](https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/), [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [Learn Open CV](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/), and [SciVision](https://www.scivision.co/install-opencv-python-windows/); however, this is still a challenging process non-advanced Linux users due to the many versions of OpenCV, Ubuntu, and associated dependencies.  

In our case, because we already use the excellent Anaconda Python package installer, it makes a lot of sense to install OpenCV this way.  

On another note, ROS Kinetic includes a version of the OpenCV-Python library in its default installation.  However, because it is packaged with ROS, this version is not necessarily updated as often as is desriable.  In these instructions, we will install (and import) the most up-to-date version of the OpenCV-Python library without conflicting with the version installed with ROS.  

## FAQs
__What is the difference between OpenCV 2 and OpenCV 3?__

Based on the name, you may infer than OpenCV 2 is the distribution of OpenCV for Python 2.7, and OpenCV 3 is the distribution of OpenCV for Python 3.x; however, this is not the case.  Simply put, OpenCV 2 is an older version of OpenCV.  OpenCV 3 is the most current version (at the time of writing) with all of the newest library wrappers.  In short, you should be using OpenCV 3.

__If I am using OpenCV 3, why is the Python import call `import cv2`?  Shouldn't it be `import cv3`?__

Admittedly, this is confusing.  [According to this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44102738/why-cant-i-import-opencv3-even-though-the-package-is-installed), although you are using OpenCV 3, the Python library is still called `cv2` because `cv2` is *not* named after the version of OpenCV, it is named after the actual C++ API underneath, which is, to be contrasted from the older C API, named `cv2`.  So the module will likely be called `cv2` for a very long time (regardless of the actual version of OpenCV).  For brevity, it is common to `import cv2 as cv` in Python.  

__Doesn't ROS come with a version of OpenCV?__

Yes.  But because it is distributed with ROS, it is not necessarily the most up-to-date distribution an OpenCV developer would desire.  This tutorial will show you how to safely install, and import the newest version of the OpenCV-Python library without conflicting with the version installed with ROS.  

## Installing OpenCV into your `base` and `py36` virtual environment using Anaconda
If you followed the instructions on the Anaconda Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 install carefully, you should now have an installation of Python 2.7 in your base Python environment, and an installation of Python 3.6 in an environment called `py36`.  Although OpenCV supports both Python 2.7 and 3.6, ROS only supports Python 2.7, which means that we will be using the `base` environment when we need to interact between OpenCV and ROS; however, for sake of completeness, we will install the respective version of the OpenCV Python library to both the `base` (Python 2.7) and `py36` (Python 3.6) environments of our computers.

First, you can check for the latest version of OpenCV in the conda package installer by typing:

```
conda search opencv
```

This will list all of the packages in the `conda` package installer that have the word 'opencv' in its name.  At the time of writing, the latest version of opencv available is version 3.4.1.  To install, type:

```
conda install opencv
```

`conda` should then prompt you to install the latest version of OpenCV it has in it's package repository.  Alternatively, if you wish to explicitly specify a verion of opencv to install, you can type:

```
conda install opencv=3.4.1
```

Accept all of the prompts on the installer screens.  You should now have the Python 2.7 version of OpenCV installed onto your computers `base` environment.  

Now to install OpenCV into our `py36` environment, first enter the `py36` environment by typing:

```
source activate py36
```

Identical to before, to install OpenCV, type:

```
conda install opencv
```

Double check to make sure that the OpenCV builds you are installing are for Python 3.6 and *not* Python 2.7.  As long as you are inside the `py36` environment, `conda` should be smart enough to figure this out.  

You should now have The Python 2.7 OpenCV library installed in your `base` (Python 2.7) environment, and you should have the Python 3.6 OpenCV library installed in your `py36` (Python 3.6) environment.

## Avoiding conflicting OpenCV Python package import calls (and any Python package import for that matter)
As alluded to in the FAQ section, the default installation of ROS comes with a version of Python 2.7, with a number of associated packages.  We do not necessarily wish to use the Python binary that came with ROS, but it is important to know where the Python packages are located.

   - ROS Kinetic Python 2.7 packages: `/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`
   - Anaconda 2 Python 2.7 `base` environment packages: `~/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages`
   - Anaconda 2 Python 3.6 `py36` environment packages: `~/anaconda2/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages`

Note that all `conda` virtual environments are stored in `~/anaconda3/envs`, and any other virtual environments you create will follow a similar directory structure.  

Although our Python packages are safely isolated in different directories , any running version of Python (even incompatible versions!) can call them, regardless of the virtual environment its running in, provided that Python knows where the symbolic library import link is located.  These directory information is stored in your `PYTHONPATH` variable, which is loaded each time a new Python interpreter is loaded.  In a Unix system, you can control what ends up on the `PYTHONPATH` using the `.bashrc` scipt.  As long as you launch Python (or your Python IDE) from a terminal window sourcing .bashrc, your `PYTHONPATH` will be repeatably generated.

Because both ROS and Anaconda 2 have source inclusions to the `.bashrc` (see our [standard .bashrc inclusions](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/.bashrc_inclusions), all of the Python libraries contained within those installation directories are on the `PYTHONPATH`.  This means, that *all* of the previously mentioned directory paths are loaded into the `PYTHONPATH` variable by default.  These packages can potentially conflict with each other, particularly if you have multiple versions of the same package.  E.g. you might unknowingly import the Python 2.7 version of, when you really wanted the Python 3.6 version.

One potential workaround would be to edit the `.bashrc` sources to only include the packges that we're using at the moment; however, this is a non-universal solution can cause unexpected behaviors from other scripts that rely on those `.bashrc` inclusions.  A more general solution is to keep *all* of the Python package imports (as is currently the case), and explicitly remove and append directory paths to the `PYTHONPATH` variable, on a per-script basis, to import the packages we want.

An example Python code that *excludes* (removes) the ROS Python 2.7 OpenCV package from the `PYTHONPATH` is given as.
   
```
# Put this code BEFORE your import call to remove all ROS Python 2.7 packages.
import sys
if any('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
import cv2
```

In this code, we search the `PYTHONPATH` for the path `/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`.  If it finds it in the `PYTHONPATH`, it will remove it.  Therefore, when the `import cv2` line executes, Python will *not* search that directory path for `cv2`. 

Note that the `PYTHONPATH` variable is loaded only when a new Python interpreter is loaded.  Therefore, once you remove a path from the `PYTHONPATH`, trying to remove the same path again will throw an error (hance why the `if` statement is necessary).  

Conversely, an example Python code that *includes* the ROS Python 2.7 OpenCV library from the `PYTHONPATH` is given as.

```
# Put this code BEFORE your import call to include all ROS Python 2.7 packages.
import sys
if not any('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.append('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
import cv2

```

You can insert this code in between your import calls as necessary to include the libraries that you need in your particular script.  

If you are interested in printing a list of the directories on the PYTHONPATH (the .bashrc will not necessarily tell you this explicitly), you may do this with the following Python code:
   
```
import sys
print(sys.path)
print(' ')
```

## Testing your installation with an example Python import script

Launch spyder in your base environment (Python 2.7) by opening a new terminal and typing:

```
spyder
```

In the code below, the Anaconda Python package directory paths are removed from the `PYTHONPATH`, then OpenCV (`cv2`) is imported, which imports the ROS-installed version of OpenCV.  Then, the ROS Python package directory paths are removed, and the Anaconda Python packge directory paths are added back into the `PYTHONPATH`.  Upon reloading `cv2`, the Anaconda-installed version of OpenCV is now loaded.  The OpenCV version, and the directory it was imported from are printed for each import/reload.  This should give you an idea of how you can manipulate the `PYTHONPATH` to control which Python packges are imported on a per-script basis.  

Note that it was unecessary to remove and append *all* of the Anaconda Python package directory paths, only the one that contained the `cv2` module symbolic link.  But for completeness, this was done anyway.

```
# Import packages for manipulating PYTHONPATH 
import sys
import getpass

# Ensure ROS Python 2.7 packages are added to PYTHONPATH
if not any('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.append('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
# Ensure all Anaconda Python 2.7 packages are removed from PYTHONPATH
if any('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python27.zip')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-tk')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-old')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages')
    sys.path.remove('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/extensions')   

# Import cv2 (OpenCV) package from ROS directory
if 'cv2' not in sys.modules:
    import cv2
else:
    reload(cv2)

# Print ROS OpenCV version and directory location
print(' ')
print('ROS OpenCV version:          ' + cv2.__version__)
print('ROS OpenCV directory:        ' + cv2.__file__)

# Ensure ROS Python 2.7 packages are removed from PYTHONPATH
if any('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
# Ensure all Anaconda Python 2.7 packages are added to PYTHONPATH
if not any('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2' in s for s in sys.path):
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python27.zip')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-tk')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-old')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages')
    sys.path.append('/home/'+getpass.getuser()+'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/extensions')   
    
# Import cv2 (OpenCV) package from Anaconda directory
reload(cv2)

# Print Anaconda OpenCV version and directory location
print(' ')
print('Anaconda OpenCV version:     ' + cv2.__version__)
print('Anaconda OpenCV directory:   ' + cv2.__file__)
```
