# OpenCV-Python
OpenCV stands for "Open Computer Vision", and is a collection of C/C++ libraries specific for computer vison.  It has interfaces/APIs in C++, Python, and Java. 

## Alternative Installation Options
OpenCV-Python can be insatlled using apt repositories (e.g. `sudo apt-get install python-opencv`); however, these repositories are generally out of date for OpenCV, and therefore are not ideal.  Aternatively, one can build from source; however, the official installation instructions found [at this link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html) are fairly poor.  There are third party instrcutions for installing from source like those from [Manuel Ignacio LÃ³pez Quintero](https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/), [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [Learn Open CV](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/), and [SciVision](https://www.scivision.co/install-opencv-python-windows/); however, this is still a challenging process non-advanced Linux users due to the many versions of OpenCV, Ubuntu, and associated dependencies.  

In our case, because we already use the excellent Anaconda Python package installer, it makes a lot of sense to install OpenCV this way.  

## Prerequisites
   1. Ubuntu 16.04 ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/Ubuntu)).
   2. Anaconda Python installation ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/AnacondaPython)).
   3. ROS Kinetic ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/ROS/Kinetic/InstallatonInstructions)).  Note that ROS is not actually required for this installation, rather ROS causes some issues with the OpenCV Python installation, and therefore some workaround instructions are provided in this guide.
   4. Standard .bashrc inclusions ([instructions here](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SoftwareInstallation/.bashrc_inclusions)).

## Installation instructions

   1. If you installed an earlier release of OpenCV using Apt, uninstall using:

```
sudo apt-get autoremove libopencv-dev python-opencv
```

   2. Update Apt repositories

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

   3. Install OpenCV and OpenCV3 using Anaconda.  Note that we are getting OpenCV through [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv), and OpenCV3 through [menpo](https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv3).

```
conda update -n base conda
conda install -c conda-forge opencv 
conda install -c menpo opencv3
```

   4. Because ROS Kinetic (or any edition of ROS for that matter)  natively uses Python 2.7, and has it's own computer vision file (`cv2.so`) which overrides any other Python import request to OpenCV.  This is located in the `/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`, which is called when ROS is activated in our .bashrc inclusions (`source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash`).  There are a few workarounds for this; we could remove that line from the .bashrc inclusions; however, that will mean that any Python 2.7 script called from ther terminal in ROS will break, which is not an ideal solution.  Instead, ensure that any Python script you write that utilizes OpenCV contains the folloing code before the import calls:
   
```
while True:
    try:
        sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
        break
    except ValueError:
        print('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages aready removed from sys.path')
        print(' ')
        break
```
   This code will remove the `/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` from the PYTHONPATH, leaving only the Anaconda (and any other import paths you may have on your system) import path.  The try-catch syntax is necessary because after the path has been removed from the interpreter, subsequent calls will throw an error (trying to remove a path that does not exist).  

   5. Install the dependencies.  Note that there is some flexibility on which packages are necessary here.  This is a generous list of dependencies, some of which may already be installed on your system:

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake pkg-config
sudo apt-get install -y libjpeg8-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev

# Remove any previous installations of x264
sudo apt-get remove -y x264 libx264-dev

# Necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential checkinstall cmake pkg-config yasm
sudo apt-get install -y git gfortran
