/*
 * This code is used to run the killswitch system. The Arduino is powered by the main power supply in the high current box going through a 12 V regulator. 
 * 5 V goes out to the two physical kill switches which loops back into two pins on the Arduino. When the switches are KILLED, the circuit breaks and the Arduino 
 * reads the pin as LOW. If the switches are UNKILLED, the Arduino reads the pin as HIGH. For the remote killswitch, the Arduino interprets the PWM signal coming 
 * from the receiver to infer the remote killswitch state. If any of these switches are KILLED, a software switch is KILLED, and the system is KILLED.
