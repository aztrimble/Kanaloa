/*
 * This code is used to run the killswitch system. The Arduino sends 5V out to the two physical kill switches which loops back into a pin on the Arduino. When the switches are 
 * engaged, the circuit breaks and the Arduino reads the pin as LOW. If the switches are disengaged, the Arduino reads the pin as HIGH. For the remote killswitch, the Arduino
 * interprets the PWM signal coming from the receiver to infer the remote killswitch state. If any of these switches are engaged, a software switch is engaged, and the system 
 * is killed.
