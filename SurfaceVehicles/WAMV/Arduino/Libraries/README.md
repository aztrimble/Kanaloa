# Arduino Libraries

Repository for all necessary Arduino libraries including: 
    - Preinstalled libraries (installed through Library Manager)
    - Libraries downloaded from the internet and installed as .zip files
    - Custom libraries written by Team Kanaloa

It is important to have a repository for all required libraries in case any of 
them were to get pulled from the library manager and become no longer
available.
