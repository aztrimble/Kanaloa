Do not commit edits to the master branch **until they have been fully vetted in hardware**!

## 1. Directory listing
 - `Documentation`: tutorials, primer documents, and detailed notes on specific topics.
 - `Projects`: files related to a specific project or event.
 - `SurfaceVehicles`: files related to the operation of a specific surface vehicle.

## 2. Directory and filename convention

### 2.1. Directory naming convention
All directories shall start with a capital letter.  If the directory name has multiple words, capitalize the first letter of subsequent words; you may use underscores `_` when necessary, but do so sparingly.  No spaces in directory names.  Example: `SampleDirectory`.

### 2.2. File naming convention

 - **For files requiring manual version control**, the filenames shall start with the date that file was originally created.  This is in the format `YYYYMMDD_name`.  `name` must start with a lowercase letter.  If `name` has multiple words, capitalize the first letter of subsequent words; you may use underscores `_` when necessary, but do so sparingly.  No spaces in filenames.  Example: `20180101_sampleFilename.extension`.  Examples of files that require manual version control include: code, notes, work in progress, etc.  You will need to use your judgement when deciding which files need manual version control.  Github automatically handles version control by nature; however, it makes sense to create manual versions of code for minor milestones.  
 - **For files that do not require manual version control**, follow the same naming convention as above, omitting the date.  Example: `sampleFilename.extension`.

**Exceptions**:
 - Matlab (in Linux) dislikes filenames that start with numbers.  For this reason, Matlab script `.m` filenames should begin with the letter `m`.  Other than this, the naming convention remains the same.  Example: `m20180101_sampleMatlabFilename.m`
 - Arduino IDE (in Linux) dislikes filenames that start with numbers.  It also prefers that .ino scrips sit inside a directory with the same name as the filename.  For this reason, Arduino script `.ino` filenames should begin with the letter a.  The script should sit inside a directory named identical to the filename.  Other than this, the naming convention remains the same.  Example: `.../a20180101_sampleArduinoFilename/a20180101_sampleArduinoFilename.ino`

## 3. Writing readme.md files
For writing tutorials and/or primer dicuments in Git, put the document in its own directory.  Name the directory a properly descriptive name (e.g. "InstallationInstructions", "PackageLists", "WritingAPackage", etc.), then name the document inside the directory "readme.md".  This will allow you to leverage Git's [built-in writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), which will allow you to write nicely-formatted documents like the one you are reading right now!
