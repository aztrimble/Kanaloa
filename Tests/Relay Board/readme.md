# Configuration
1. Attach Arduino 5V line to relay board's VCC pin. 
2. Attach Arduino GND line to relay board's GND pin.
3. Attach Arduino pin 5 to relay board's IN1 pin (this is relay 1).
4. Attach Arduino pin 6 to relay board's IN2 pin (this is relay 2).
5. Upload Arduino code. The lights should alternate every 5 seconds. Details on how the code works are recorded
  by comments within the code.
